At this moment application can register new users, login, show profile and show all users that registered.
Now i have a problem with encoding, it mean that cyrillic symbols have bad displaying. Profile button working only after login. If u reload page, profile will not display.

------------------

What in future?
---------------------
- Add to user photos and display that with posts and in profile. 
- May be add public or/and private chat.
