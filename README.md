At this moment application can register new users, login, show profile and show all users that registered.
Now i have a problem with encoding, it mean that cyrillic symbols have bad displaying. Profile button working only after login. If u reload page, profile will not display.

------------------

What in future?
---------------------
- Now as model are Collections - List of Strings XD, but in future i will connect PostgresDB and use JDBC to add users, photos, other
- Realise CRUD, it means that user can delete his page or update some information about him, for example.
- Add page with user posts.
- Add to user photos and display that with posts and in profile. 
- May be add public or/and private chat.
